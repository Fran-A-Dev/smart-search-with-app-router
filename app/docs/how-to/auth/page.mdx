# Authentication

Authentication is a key part of many web applications today. It's how a system checks if the user is who they say they are.

A secure website often uses multiple ways to check a user's identity. For instance, after entering your username and password, the site may send a verification code to your device or use an external app like Google Authenticator. This 2-factor authentication (2FA) helps increase security. Even if someone learns your password, they can't access your account without your unique token.

Here is some code:

```js
import AcmeLogo from "@/app/ui/acme-logo";
import LoginForm from "@/app/ui/login-form";

export default function LoginPage() {
  return (
    <main className="flex items-center justify-center md:h-screen">
      <div className="relative mx-auto flex w-full max-w-[400px] flex-col space-y-2.5 p-4 md:-mt-32">
        <div className="flex h-20 w-full items-end rounded-lg bg-blue-500 p-3 md:h-36">
          <div className="w-32 text-white md:w-36">
            <AcmeLogo />
          </div>
        </div>
        <LoginForm />
      </div>
