3. **WordPress Installation:**

   - A running WordPress site with posts and MDX pages (docs) that you want to include in the search.

4. **Environment Variables:**
   - You'll need to configure specific environment variables to connect your Next.js application with WordPress and WP Engine's Smart Search.
